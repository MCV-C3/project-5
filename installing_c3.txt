#(you can choose whatever version of python you want, however I work with this version)

conda create --name c3 python==3.10.14
conda activate c3 


## Pytorch installation
## in the cluster the cuda version is the 12.1, so the you need to install a torch version that fits in this cuda version
## This is the stablest one that supports cuda 12.1

pip install torch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
